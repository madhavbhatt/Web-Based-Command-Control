This is a web based command control for windows, mac OS and linux.  

Upcoming Features:
 1. Unless victim connects to c2, it would server as a web site without redirector so that IP vicitm connects to matches IP of web site being serverd.
 2. Website being serverd would be dynamic and legit.
 3. If the domain gets blocked or if the blue team is onto c2, payload would automatically go to sleep for a while and joined to the new c2 infrastructure. This would help not lose beacons which happend in traditional red teams.

This infrasctructure along with proxy would make a robust red team infrastructure.
